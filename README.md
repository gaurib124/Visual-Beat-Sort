# VisualBeat Sort

VisualBeat Sort is an interactive educational tool that combines animation and sound to visualize the Bubble Sort algorithm. Using HTML5 Canvas for visuals and the Web Audio API for audio feedback, this project makes learning sorting algorithms more engaging and accessible.

## Description

VisualBeat Sort uses HTML5 Canvas to represent array elements as animated bars that move across the screen, visually showing each comparison and swap as they occur in real-time. The Web Audio API adds sound feedback for each swap, giving users an auditory cue to follow along with the visual changes. With color-coded elements, sorting speed controls, and sound toggles, this tool provides a multi-sensory experience that is ideal for students and learners interested in understanding sorting algorithms.

## Features

- **Real-Time Sorting Animation**: Bars move smoothly on the canvas, representing array values and showing the sorting progress.
- **Audio Feedback for Swaps**: Sound effects align with each comparison and swap, helping reinforce sorting steps through sound.
- **Color-Coded Elements**: Colors indicate active comparisons, swaps, and sorted positions, making the sorting process easier to track.
- **User Controls**: Adjust sorting speed, color themes, and toggle sound to customize the experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 Canvas**: Renders the array elements and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Manages sorting logic and user interactions.
- **Web Audio API**: Generates sound feedback during sorting actions.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VisualBeat-Sort.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to launch the visualization.

## Usage

1. Start the sorting visualization to see animated bars and hear sound feedback.
2. Adjust the speed and sound options to create a personalized learning experience.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional sorting algorithms (e.g., Insertion Sort, Selection Sort).
- Step-by-step mode for a more detailed breakdown of sorting actions.
- Customizable sound frequencies based on array values to create a “musical” sorting experience.
